A productivity tool for intensive working sessions

The user visiting the site will be able to enter the number of hours they want to work. Depending on the number, an algorithm will divide the total time into periods of work and recess. An alarm will ring to signal a transition from one session to the next. The goal is to provide cues that allow the user to adhere to a highly productive working schedule, that contains effective time proportions for work and leisure.
